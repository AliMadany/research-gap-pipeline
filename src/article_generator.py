    Write a professional contractor article about "{gap_topic}" following this structure, but DO NOT include any section headers, word count indicators, or template instructions in your output. Write it as a natural, flowing article that sounds like a human contractor wrote it.

    Structure to follow (but don't include these labels):

    1. Start with a compelling hook (75-100 words) using one of these styles:
    - Problem/Solution Hook: "When [Client] called us last month, their [surface] was a safety hazard costing them [consequence]. Three weeks later? Completely transformed and $[amount] in added property value."
    - Dramatic Transformation: "You wouldn't recognize the [property] on [Street] in [City]. What was once [problem] is now [positive outcome]. Here's how we did it in [timeframe]."
    - Results Teaser: "Last month's [Area] project proves the right [service] can transform more than pavementâ€”it transforms your entire property."

    2. Tell the project story (150-200 words) covering:
    - The Problem: Brief description of client's specific issue
    - Our Solution: Concise explanation of approach taken  
    - The Results: Specific outcomes and benefits achieved
    - Why It Worked: Brief explanation of why professional service made the difference

    3. Explain why {city.title()} properties need professional {service} (100-150 words):
    "{city.title()}'s climate challenges create unique problems for surfaces. Common issues include: [3 specific problems]. Professional {service} solves these problems with proper materials, installation techniques, and local expertise that DIY approaches can't match."

    4. Describe the {service} process (75-100 words):
    Assessment, Preparation, Installation, Protection - each designed for {city}'s conditions.

    5. List benefits for {city.title()} property owners (100-125 words):
    Durability, Safety, Value, Cost-Effectiveness

    6. Cover maintenance for {city.title()} conditions (75-100 words):
    Seasonal care throughout the year

    7. Explain why to choose local {city.title()} contractors (75-100 words):
    Local expertise and community investment

    8. End with getting started section (50-75 words):
    Call-to-action with services offered

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - DO NOT include any section headers like "**Project Story Opening**" or "**The Project Story**"
    - DO NOT include word count indicators like "(75-100 words)"
    - DO NOT include any template instructions or backend notes
    - Write as one flowing article that reads naturally
    - Replace ALL bracketed placeholders with realistic, specific details
    - Use concrete examples and numbers (dollar amounts, timeframes, measurable results)
    - Sound like a real contractor wrote it, not an AI
    - Total word count: 500-750 words
    - Focus on local conditions for {city}
